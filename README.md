# NetScope
Semantic Network Exploration &amp; Community Detection

ðŸ§  Overview
NetScope is a collaborative data science project focused on constructing, visualizing, and analyzing a semantic network derived from lab notebooks. Using networkx, this project walks through a comprehensive journey of semantic network analysis, covering key network parameters, centrality measures, community detection algorithms, and ranking metrics.
This project showcases how graph-based models can uncover hidden structures, key nodes, and communities in complex semantic systems. By using a series of visualizations and algorithms, we gain insights into the organization, flow, and importance of concepts within our dataset.
